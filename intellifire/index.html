        Impeccable seperation of Business logic and machinery - Frameworks are
        isolated in individual modules - Changes only have to change one place,
        with the rest of the app not even knowing about it or caring

        a.k.a. it screams its intended usage. When you look at the package
        structure you get a feel for what the application does rather than
        seeing technical details
