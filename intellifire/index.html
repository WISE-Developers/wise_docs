        Impeccable seperation of Business logic and machinery - Frameworks are
        isolated in individual modules - Changes only have to change one place,
        with the rest of the app not even knowing about it or caring
      </li>
      <li>The app has use cases rather than being tied to a CRUD system</li>

          >Screaming architecture</a
        >
        a.k.a. it screams its intended usage. When you look at the package
        structure you get a feel for what the application does rather than
        seeing technical details
      </li>
      <li>
        All business logic is in a use case so it's easy to find and it's not
        duplicated anywhere else
      </li>

        uses a

        to separate APIs by entity.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is always ready to deploy by leaving the wiring up of the object for
        last or by using feature flags, so we get all the benefits of continuous
        integration
      </li>
      <li>
        Multiple works on stories so that different pairs can easily work on the
        same story at the same time to complete it quicker
      </li>
      <li>
        Good monolith with clear use cases that you can split in microservices
        later one, once you've learnt more about them
